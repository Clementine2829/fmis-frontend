# FMIS Frontend

Welcome to the **FMIS Frontend** repository! This is the client-side application for the **Farm Management Information System (FMIS)**. It allows users to interact with their farm data, manage farms, and visualize NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) through an intuitive web interface.

The frontend is built using **React.js**, **Axios** for API calls, and **CSS Modules** for styling.
